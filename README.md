# Experimentation_with_LSTM
Sentiment Analysis with LSTM (TensorFlow)

This project is a simple attempt at Sentiment Analysis using an LSTM model built in TensorFlow/Keras.
The main goal was to practice working with recurrent networks on text data, rather than achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.

üìå Project Overview

Implemented a dense LSTM-based model in TensorFlow

Trained on a small dataset (which limited performance)

Ran for many epochs to explore training behavior

Results were not very strong ‚Äî the model struggled to generalize

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

Numpy, Pandas

üí° Advice for Improvements

While this experiment was more about learning than results, here are a few ideas that could improve performance in future projects:

Use a larger dataset to capture more context

Start with a pretrained model (e.g., BERT, DistilBERT)

Fine-tune open-source models instead of training from scratch

Consider using a Sentiment Analysis API if the goal is production-ready results
